# Question
Check out [the docs for the rest operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) for this question.

What's the difference between the spread operator and the rest operator?

Even though they are both `...`, a spread operator takes an array and "spreads" out it's elements into another array, while a rest operator collects all function arguments into an array. Examples:

#### Rest Parameter
```js
const printStrings = (...strings) => { //Rest parameter takes all incoming arguments and stores them in an array called "strings" in-order
  for(let i = 0; i < strings.length; i++) {
    console.log(strings[i]);
  }
}
printStrings("fiona", "rashell", "abdullah");
```

##### Spread Operator
```js
const addTwo = (nums) => {
  let newNums = [...nums]; //Spread operator uses the passed in array's elements and spreads them into a new array called newNums, this helps make this a pure function because creating "newNums" with spread operator no longer affects the original passed in "nums" array
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    newNums.push(nums[i] + 2);
  }
  return newNums;
}
let nums = [1,2,3,4,5];
console.log(addTwo(nums));
```
