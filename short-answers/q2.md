# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Is `addBostonToFavorites` a pure function? Why or why not?

# Answer
No it is not a pure function because it changes the original array.
